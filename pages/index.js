        <p>Hello, My Name is Sean Glenn Magcalas, I am an 3rd year IT student</p>

      <hr></hr>

        <p><strong>1.  Introduce yourself.  What are your hobbies, favourite music, favourite food, and other things you can tell me about yourself?</strong></p>

<p>My name is Sean Glenn B. Magcalas, I am 21 years old, and was born on November 30,2002, I am from San Nicolas, Santa Ana, Pampanga. I am inclined with artistic stuff, particularly visual arts and music. Music is a very important part of my life. It helps me explore different feelings and emotions, my favorite music style is rock and my favorite musician/band is The Beatles. I am also a big eater, I am not that picky and my favorite dish is Sinigang. I am an irregular student and before being an IT student, I have taken first Accountancy as my first course. The reason why I shifted is I did not find myself as an accountant, I feel like my mind is not in line with the work there. So I have shifted to BSIT.</p>

<p><strong>2.  Why did you take up IT?</strong></p>

<p>Like what I said earlier, I am an irregular student, I am a former student of BSA in the University of the Assumption. When I was in BSA I felt like I was in a cage and my mind was not inclined to the things that I learned from there. I felt like my creativity was of no use there. That is why when I decided to shift, I made sure that I can use my creativity in the next course that I will choose and so I have chosen BSIT. I was always fascinated by how different computer systems work, how people can make something from nothing. I was intrigued with how people use different codes to make something functional, that is why I have chosen BSIT. I want to use my creativity to make something from nothing.
